The Witch Next Door

Sam and Amy lived next door to a very strange old woman. She always wore
a black crooked hat, she kept a black cat, and she'd give a cackling laugh
whenever she spoke. On Halloween, they decided to knock on her door to see
if she would give them any lollies. But when she opened the door she said,
"Like lollies, do you? Well, I'd better give you some then."

There was a puff of smoke and Sam realised that his Arm had
turned into a Gummy Bear! There was another puff of smoke and Amy
had a huge Chocolate where her Leg had been!

Just as there was another puff, the black cat jumped up into the smoke. When
it fell down to the ground it had turned into a very large, cross-looking
Dog. The Dog chased the old woman back into her house,
clawing at her Dress.

Sam and Amy's bodies went back to normal after a while, but they didn't eat a
Gummy Bear or Chocolate for a long time afterwards!
